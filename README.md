# KidReads
## A place to discover, discuss, and share children's books.

App Academy Student Final Project by Julie Kang.
Single-Page book sharing app inspired by GoodReads.
Backbone.js on Rails.    
Developed in 6 Days.
http://kidreads.herokuapp.com/ for a demo.

###TODO:

+ Scheduled API calls to update the books table from GoodReads
+ Infinite scrolling of search results and activity stream
+ Pruning of activity stream: if someone rates over and over, just post once
+ Set things up so that only parents can sign up, then sign their own kids up
    + Parents can then add their own kids to clubs they've created
    + Club leaders can then add other parents to join their clubs, who can then add their own kids.
+ Update user accounts
+ Implement the "D" of CRUD: delete reviews, ratings, user accounts
+ In-club discussion board with nested comments
+ Data mining
    + book recommendations
+ Display books in columns in user show page, maybe horizontal scrolling?
