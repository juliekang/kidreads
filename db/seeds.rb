# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# ut1 = UserType.create(label: "Kid", 
#         description: "Kids can rate books, post reviews, track their own progress, and participate in book clubs.")
# ut2 = UserType.create(label: "Parent", 
#         description: "Parents can create Reading Families as well as monitor their kids' progress.")
# ut3 = UserType.create(label: "Teacher", 
#         description: "Teachers can create classrooms and monitor all their students' progress.")
