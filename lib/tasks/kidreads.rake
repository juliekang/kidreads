# Book data collection needs to be a multi-pass process.

# Pass #1 -- collect all books available via the Goodreads Genre search for "children" (there are related genres but that's probably enough for now)
# In "books" table, upsert values for: title, image_url, small_image_url, goodreads_id, publication_year, publication_month, publication_day, publisher, description
# In 'goodreads_metadata' table, upsert values for: id, goodreads_id, ratings_count, text_reviews_count, average_rating
# Note: when the Kidreads user is searching for a book later, the ratings/reviews info from Goodreads can be used as one weighting factor
# Harry Potter has a million reviews, crappy hits like "Children Within Environments: Toward a Psychology of Accident Prevention", have zero.

# Pass #2 -- for each book, look up author and ISBN from Goodreads, if it's new
# In "authors" table: isbn, name, goodreads_author_id
# Note: skip those that say "box set" or where author name is "Unknown Author"

# Pass #3 -- collect grade level info from Amazon somehow, probably by scraping their web UI using Mechanize.
# This can be omitted for MVP.
